### Typography
The fonts used are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Special%20Elite%7CVast%20Shadow). 
Special Elite imitates typewritter font which fits perfectly with the theme of the game. Vast Shadow was used to create the logo in the header.
### Images
There are two images used in the game. The background image fits wll with the theme of the game and the typewritter font. The papyrus image on the 404 page was selected to provide better visual experience. Links to both can be found in Credits section.
### Wireframes
### Mockups
Early mockups using Photoshop. These were created to provide visual guide for coding the structure of the website. Later on during development additional screens were added for the highscore function and the how to play modal on the welcome screen.
